# Execution environment metadata for the VMware vSphere provider.
# Format: same as Ansible collection meta/execution-environment.yml
#
# ansible-builder reads this to locate dependency files when building
# execution environment container images. If this file is absent,
# ansible-builder falls back to requirements.txt and bindep.txt
# at the provider package root.

dependencies:
  python: requirements.txt
  system: bindep.txt
